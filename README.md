## Troubleshooting

| Issue                      | Solution                                                                 |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API not responding         | Ensure server is running and `.env` is configured correctly              |
| Database connection failed | Confirm PostgreSQL is running and credentials are correct                |
| Emails not sending         | Set up valid SMTP credentials in `.env`                                  |
| React app not loading data | Confirm `axios` base URL matches the backend server                      |
